# Credit-Score-Prediction
Deploy ML model to predict customer credit scores , the model helps financial institutions assess creditworthiness, enabling informed lending decisions and risk management."

* Data Preprocessing: Applied statistical measures, data cleaning, exploration, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset.
* Data Analysis: Performed correlation analysis, handled outliers and unrealistic values, and balanced the dataset using upsampling techniques.
* Data Transformation: Implemented encoding, scaling, and cross-validation to optimize the dataset for machine learning.
* Model Training: Trained and evaluated multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and XGBoost, using precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilized Grid Search to fine-tune model parameters for improved performance.
* Deployment: Built a Flask application to deploy the final model and saved it using Pickle for reuse.
